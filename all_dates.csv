The used estimate in USD is conservative. Description on IMF website: 'A package of fiscal measures was announced to contain the economic impact of the outbreak. The package includes spending measures of about 10-20 billion euros (1-2 percent of GDP) in the next three months, and covering (i) compensation of up to 90 percent of labor costs for companies expecting a reduction in revenues of 20 percent or more; (ii) compensation for affected sectors (hospitality, travel, and others); (iii) support for entrepreneurs and the self-employed; (iv) scaling up of the short-time working scheme (unemployment benefit compensation available to companies needing to reduce their staff by at least 20 percent). In addition, companies can defer tax payments without penalties, and calculate provisional taxes on the basis of expected reduced activity levels. Also, public guarantee schemes, especially for SME loans, are expanded to help the most vulnerable companies to manage their liquidity problems. The total cost of these programs will depend on demand.'

'We will provide additional support to those companies when needed,' the president said.
He said credit payments of craftspeople and artisans to state lender Halkbank will also be delayed for three months without interest.

Since February, following the emergency declaration for dengue and coronavirus, Honduras approved a budgetary support of $4.4 million for the preparation of the imminent arrival of COVID-19 in Honduras.

Subsequently, President Hernandez lead the approval in Congress of the Economic Acceleration Law, which aims to immediately inject 420 million dollars into the national economy to boost the generation of 100,000 jobs, and to strengthen the social security system to guaranty assistance capacity to more than 3 million users. The initiative includes the construction and equipment of 95 health centers and 11 hospitals nationwide.
